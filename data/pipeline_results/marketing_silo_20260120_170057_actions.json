    "description": "Design and implement a foreign key constraint from conversions.campaign_id to ad_campaigns.campaign_id to ensure all recorded conversions are tied to a valid ad campaign. Steps:\n1) Profile current data to identify orphaned conversions.campaign_id values not present in ad_campaigns.campaign_id and decide on remediation (e.g., map to valid campaigns, mark as unknown, or delete).\n2) Align with marketing analytics and data ownership teams on expected behavior for invalid campaign references (reject new records vs. soft-fail in staging).\n3) Implement the FK constraint in the warehouse/OLTP schema (including ON DELETE/UPDATE behavior, typically RESTRICT or NO ACTION for analytics).\n4) Backfill and validate the constraint in lower environments before promoting to production.\n5) Update ETL/ELT pipelines to fail fast or quarantine records that violate the constraint.\nThis will improve attribution accuracy, prevent future orphaned conversions, and stabilize downstream marketing performance reporting.",

Implementation details:\n1) Define the metric: containment = (distinct conversions.campaign_id that exist in ad_campaigns.campaign_id) / (distinct conversions.campaign_id).\n2) Implement a scheduled job (e.g., dbt test, Airflow task, or warehouse-native rule) to compute this metric daily or per data load.\n3) Configure alerting thresholds: warning at 95–97%, critical alert below 95%, with notification to data owner and marketing analytics team.\n4) Log historical values of the metric to a data quality dashboard for trend analysis.\n5) Integrate with incident management (e.g., create tickets automatically when critical alerts fire).\nThis monitoring ensures the FK relationship remains healthy over time and that upstream changes or ingestion issues are detected quickly.",
