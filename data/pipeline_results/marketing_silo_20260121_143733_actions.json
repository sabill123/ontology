Steps:\n1) Profile current data to identify orphaned conversions.campaign_id values (not present in ad_campaigns.campaign_id) and quantify impact.\n2) Clean or remediate invalid campaign_id values (e.g., map to valid campaigns, mark as unknown, or remove invalid rows based on business rules).\n3) Update the DDL to add the FK constraint with appropriate ON DELETE/ON UPDATE behavior (typically RESTRICT or CASCADE based on marketing requirements).\n4) Apply the change first in a staging environment, run regression tests on ETL/ELT jobs and marketing attribution reports, then roll out to production during a controlled deployment window.\n5) Coordinate with marketing and data teams to communicate the new constraint and its implications for upstream data producers.",
